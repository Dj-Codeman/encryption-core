HI.

I found this script: https://www.fastsitephp.com/es/documents/file-encryption-bash

It uses openssl to encrypt files in a bash script.

I wanted to use this in scripts to keep encrypted files and keys on a system


I'm Currently trying to combine the "encore" and "encrypt" scripts into one.

while i learn how to do that the encore script is a sort of layer to give me the syntax that i want.
